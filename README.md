# Mikrotik_BGP_Status
BGP status of Mikrotik(MK) Devices

This project deals with Generating Alert for BGP status of Mikrotik Routers.

Mikrotik RouterOS, upto time of this writing, has not provided BGP-status OIDS. 
To circumvent this, a script is written(and will be hosted in a linux server).

This will gather BGP status for all MK routers. 
Also, an Inventory file with IP address of BGP routers is populated(File RouterID.txt). 

+ SNMP poller(NMS) will poll this Server using extended oid(1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.1.3.1). (File snmpd.conf) 
+ After this, server will execute the script and reply to NMS server with BGP peers status. (File bgpmon.sh)
+ The scripts uses python librouteros API to execute BGP command('/routing/bgp/peer/print'). (File bgp_mon.py)
+ If everything is OK (ie All bgp peer is established), 1 will be returned.
+ If there is a problem then info about the problematic peer(s) is/are returned.


Note: Install librouteros library using "pip3 install librouteros"

Here is the flow of this script: 

populate inventory with router IP(ROuterID.txt) ----> configure snmpd.conf with extend MIB ----> SNMP poller will exectue script bgpmon.sh every 5 minutes---->bgp_mon.py script will be executed-----> librouteros api is used to execute (/routing/bgp/peer/print) command ---> scripts return 1 or state to SNMP poller(NMS)--->SNMP poller(NMS) create alerts.
